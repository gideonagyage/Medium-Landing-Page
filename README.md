# Medium Landing Page (Duplicate) in React JS

## Overview

This project is part of the Codevixens Frontend Development Challenge (Day 3). The goal is a recreation of the Medium landing page, built using React. It showcases the use of components, styling, and responsive design principles.

## Features

- **Responsive Design**: The landing page adapts to different screen sizes, providing a consistent user experience across devices.
- **Hero Section**: A prominent hero section with engaging text and an illustrative image.
- **Navigation Bar**: A navigation bar with links to key Medium features.
- **Footer**: A footer with links to important resources and information.

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/gideonagyage/Medium-Landing-Page.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd Medium-Landing-Page
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install

## Usage

1. Start the development server:

## What it entails

The landing page is built using React components, each responsible for a specific section of the page. The components are styled using Bootstrap and custom CSS to achieve the desired look and feel.

1. **MediumLandingPage**: The main component that renders the entire landing page.
2. **Header**: The navigation bar component, containing the Medium logo and navigation links.
3. **Footer**: The footer component, containing links to important resources and information.
